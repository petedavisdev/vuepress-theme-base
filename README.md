# (WIP) vuepress-theme-base
> If you want to create your own VuePress theme, fork this repo!

**Note: this is work in progress - please watch for releases**


## Aims

Building themes from scratch can be daunting. Overriding a default theme can be limiting.

The aim of this theme is to provide a starter kit for designers and developers. 

This theme will include:

- a starter set of layouts and components that output accessible, semantic html
- a selection of plugins to enable you to build modern website or blog
- the best tooling for productivity and quality assurance

This theme will NOT include:

- Styles!

The idea is that you fork this repo, rename it and use it to design your own theme.
